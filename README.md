# FastAPIchat
FastAPI, PostgreSQL 17


This project aims to create a simple, but a well build 
local chat application(with notifications) based on the 
Python FastAPI framework. I started learning how to make
actually programs and this is my first project.

First, this project will almost be all python. Using the 
FastAPI the frontend will be a locally hosted website which 
the users will be able to communicate on. WebSocket will be 
used for client to server connections, and Redis and PostgreSQL 
will be used for memory management.

I will achieve greate speeds and data reliability ... (to be continued)

You can find the projects structure diagram in 
'Real-Time Chat & Notification System.drawio'.
